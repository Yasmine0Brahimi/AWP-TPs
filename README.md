# AWP Coursework Repository — Attendance App Project

This repository contains tutorial exercises and the final attendance tracking application developed for the AWP course. It is organized for clarity, grading, and future portfolio use.

## 📂 Tutorials

- `Tutorial_1`: JavaScript-based attendance app exercise.  
  Focuses on front-end logic, local data handling, and basic UI interactions.

- `Tutorial_2`: PHP-based attendance app exercise.  
  Demonstrates server-side scripting, JSON-based data storage, and modular PHP structure.

## ✅ Final Project — `Final_Attendance_App`

This is the complete attendance tracking system submitted for grading. It includes:

- Role-based access (teacher, admin, student)
- Real student names and attendance records
- Chart.js visualizations for attendance statistics
- Clean UI with dark theme and modern accents
- Organized backend using PHP and JSON
- Modular code structure for maintainability

- **Access:** Open `http://localhost/Final_Attendance_App/` in a browser.  
- **Data:** Demo users are preconfigured; the `YasmineBR` student was added through the app interface.

## 📌 Notes

- All folders are self-contained and clearly named for grading.
- The final project is fully functional and styled for presentation.
- Demo passwords are set to `1234` for teacher/admin/student; the real example `YasmineBR` uses `5678`.
